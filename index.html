      <p>I know what you're thinking. . . . A Ph.D. in Social Psychology turned Web Developer. Is she 
        going to use that good psychology voodoo stuff on my website?</p>
      <p>The answer is yes, I am.</p>
      <p>Social Psychogy is the study of how external cues influence a person's 
          internal thoughts, feelings and decisions.</p>
      <p>How does my knowledge of Social Psychology infuence how I approach web development? On the front end, there are hundreds 
          of cues for a user to process. How the website looks - the style, structure and ease of 
          navigation - can influence whether users will click what you want them to click or send them away. 
          On the backend, the seemless integration of functionaliy, data collection and storage will 
          give your company the edge over your competition.</p>
      <p> You want to make your website the best it can be. So do I.</p>
